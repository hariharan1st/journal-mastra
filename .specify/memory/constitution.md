# Journal Mastra Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Modular Architecture Mandate

- Every new capability MUST be delivered as a well-bounded module with a single, documented responsibility.
- Shared logic MUST live in reusable packages or utilities under `src/` rather than duplicated across features.
- Modules MUST expose stable contracts (function signatures, types) and hide internal details to preserve swapability.

**Rationale**: Tight modularity keeps the codebase adaptable and makes future extensions predictable without regressions.

### II. Reusable Building Blocks First

- Contributors MUST search existing modules before introducing new abstractions.
- When creating new utilities, they MUST be generic enough for at least two concrete use cases or explicitly justified otherwise.
- Cross-cutting capabilities (logging, configuration, data access) MUST use shared providers to avoid drift.

**Rationale**: Reuse prevents fragmentation, keeps maintenance effort low, and reinforces consistent behavior across the system.

### III. Readable Code Standard

- Code MUST favor clarity over cleverness: meaningful names, small functions, and inline documentation where intent is non-obvious.
- Reviewers MUST block changes that lack explanatory comments for complex flows or domain rules.
- Automated tests are OPTIONAL; when omitted, contributors MUST include runnable examples or clear manual validation notes in the PR description.

**Rationale**: Understandable code is the primary quality gate, enabling safe iteration even without a heavy testing footprint.

### IV. Security by Design

- All data inputs MUST be validated and sanitized before use; never trust external sources.
- Secrets MUST be loaded from secure configuration channels and never hard-coded or logged.
- Dependencies MUST be kept minimal and receive prompt updates when security advisories are published.

**Rationale**: Proactive security ensures user trust and protects the project as it grows in capability and visibility.

### V. Scalable Efficiency Focus

- Implementations MUST consider runtime efficiency, avoiding unnecessary network calls, blocking I/O, and excessive allocations.
- Critical paths MUST be benchmarked or reasoned about for expected concurrency and load before merge.
- Profiling hooks or logs SHOULD be added where performance characteristics are uncertain.

**Rationale**: Scalability keeps the system responsive as usage grows, reducing surprises in production environments.

## Engineering Guardrails

- Prefer TypeScript features (types, generics) to document contracts and catch defects early.
- Shared utilities MUST live under `src/mastra/` and follow a consistent folder structure: `agents/`, `models/`, `tools/`, `workflows/`.
- Configuration files (e.g., `.env`) MUST define defaults safely; production overrides belong in secure ops channels.
- Manual validation steps MUST be captured in `docs/` or PR notes so others can reproduce behavior confidently.
- Avoid introducing frameworks or heavy dependencies without demonstrating clear, measurable scalability gains.

## Delivery Workflow

1. Capture problem framing and desired behavior in a feature spec referencing this constitution.
2. Sketch module boundaries and reuse opportunities before writing code; verify alignment with Principles I and II.
3. Implement in small, reviewable increments with attention to readability, inline rationale, and security hardening.
4. Document manual validation evidence (screenshots, CLI transcripts, benchmarks) in the PR or accompanying docs.
5. Perform a post-merge review within one week to confirm runtime efficiency and identify reusable improvements for future work.

## Governance

- This constitution supersedes conflicting legacy practices. Every code review MUST confirm compliance with the principles and guardrails listed above.
- Amendments require consensus from core maintainers, a rationale describing impact on modularity, readability, security, or scalability, and updates to all dependent templates before ratification.
- Semantic versioning governs changes: MAJOR for principle rewrites/removals, MINOR for new principles or workflow steps, PATCH for clarifications.
- Compliance reviews occur at least monthly; violations MUST be cataloged with remediation plans tracked to completion.
