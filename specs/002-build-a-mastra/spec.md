# Feature Specification: Dynamic Configuration-Driven Mastra Agent

**Feature Branch**: `002-build-a-mastra`  
**Created**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a mastra agent with dynamic tools where the configuration is given as an input that follows zod schema to indicate various table names, their fields and their values to track, table names and column names mappings for each value. The agent should be capable of exposing various mcp tools based on the configuration. There should be generic tool execution where the values are sent by the LLM as part of the agent's call and the values are validated and stored in the database."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Parsed: Need dynamic agent with schema-driven tools
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Mastra agent, LLM callers, database
   → Actions: configure schema, expose tools, validate data, store values
   → Data: configuration schema, table definitions, field mappings
   → Constraints: Zod validation, generic tool execution
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Resolved: Support common data types - strings, numbers, booleans, enums, dates, JSON objects
   → Resolved: Focus on independent tables initially, relationships can be added later
   → Resolved: Support basic validation - required fields, type checking, simple constraints
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → User configures schema, agent exposes tools, LLM uses tools to store data
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Schema definition, tool generation, data validation, storage
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Configuration Schema, Table Definition, Field Mapping, Tool Instance
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All uncertainties resolved with logical defaults
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Validation _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A developer wants to create a Mastra agent that can dynamically track different types of data across multiple database tables without hardcoding the table structure. They provide a configuration schema that defines the tables, fields, and data types they want to track. The agent automatically generates appropriate MCP tools based on this configuration, allowing LLMs to store validated data in the correct database locations.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a configuration schema defining two tables with specific fields, **When** the agent initializes, **Then** it exposes corresponding MCP tools for each table
2. **Given** an LLM calls a generated tool with field values, **When** the agent processes the call, **Then** it validates the data against the schema and stores it in the correct database table
3. **Given** invalid data is provided to a tool, **When** validation occurs, **Then** the agent rejects the data with appropriate error messages
4. **Given** a configuration with field mappings between different column names, **When** data is stored, **Then** it maps to the correct database columns

### Edge Cases

- What happens when configuration schema is malformed or incomplete? throws error
- How does system handle conflicting field types between schema and database? throws error
- What occurs when LLM provides partial data for required fields? throws error, so the LLM asks the user and then calls with complete data

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept configuration input following a defined Zod schema structure
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse configuration to identify table names, field definitions, and value types to track
- **FR-003**: System MUST dynamically generate MCP tools based on the provided configuration
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate incoming data from LLM calls against the configured schema
- **FR-005**: System MUST store validated data in the correct database tables using field mappings
- **FR-006**: System MUST support generic tool execution where field values are provided by LLM calls
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle common data types including strings, numbers, booleans, enums, dates, and JSON objects
- **FR-008**: System MUST support independent tables without cross-table relationships for initial implementation
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide zod validation rules including required field checking, data type validation, and basic constraints like string length and number ranges

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Configuration Schema**: Defines the structure for specifying tables, fields, data types, and mappings that the agent will use
- **Table Definition**: Represents a database table with its name, fields, and associated data types within the configuration
- **Field Mapping**: Maps logical field names in the configuration to actual database column names for data storage
- **Tool Instance**: A dynamically generated MCP tool that corresponds to a specific table and handles data validation and storage
- **Validation Rule**: Rules applied to incoming data to ensure it matches the expected schema before database storage
